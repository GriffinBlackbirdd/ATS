  "   - Integrate in context, not just lists",
  "",
  "2. Skills Relevance (25/25 points):",
  "   - Show skills in ACTION, not just list them",
  "   - Use semantic skill pairs: 'Python for data manipulation'",
  "   - Target: 75%+ semantic similarity",
  "",
  "3. Experience Achievements (23+/25 points):",
  "   - CRITICAL: Every bullet MUST use achievement language",
  "   - Start with RESULT, then action",
  "   - Include business impact statements",
  "   - Use NLP-recognized achievement patterns",
  "",
  "4. Formatting Compliance (10/10 points):",
  "   - Email + phone + 3 essential sections",

  "[Quantified Result] + [Achievement Verb] + [Business Impact] through [Technical Skill]",
  "",
  "ACHIEVEMENT INDICATORS (NLP looks for these):",
  "- Verbs: achieved, resulted in, led to, delivered, produced, enhanced, improved",
  "- Outcomes: resulting in, leading to, which improved, thereby reducing",
  "- Impact: profitability, efficiency, performance, accuracy, revenue",
  "",
  "BEFORE vs AFTER EXAMPLES:",
  "",
  "Example 1 - Data Pipeline:",
  "❌ BEFORE: 'Developed an end-to-end real-time data pipeline on Azure using Apache Airflow'",
